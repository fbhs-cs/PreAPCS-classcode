Encryption Algorithm
1. Decide on a key from 1 to 25.
2. Find the plaintext letter's number
3. Add the key to the plaintext letter's number
4. If this number is larger than 26, subtract 26.
5. Find the letter for the number calculated. This
   is the cipher text letter.
6. Repeat steps 2 to 5 for every letter in the plaintext
   message.

Decryption Algorithm
1. Given a key from 1 to 25.
2. Find the ciphertext letter's number
3. Subtract the key from the ciphertext letter's number
4. If this number is negative, add 26.
5. Find the letter for the number calculated. This
   is the plaintext letter.
6. Repeat steps 2 to 5 for every letter in the ciphertext
   message.
